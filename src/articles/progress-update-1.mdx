**ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Miguel Piedrafita, the maker behind Auralite.** After [announcing Auralite a few days ago](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf/status/1275815147248979968), I've been hard at work adding new features and fixing bugs, getting the platform ready for the beta. Here's what's new.

## A peek at the onboarding

I'm sure you can't wait to see how Auralite looks, so I decided to record **a quick video showing how creating an account feels like**. The design is still a work in progress, but the structure is there.

Keep in mind the final product will include more documentation regarding why each step is required, and that the ordering isn't final.

## Platform updates: Open Source!

*Openness is a big part of Auralite*, and our Open API is the best example of this value. To illustrate the capabilites of this API and create a reference others can follow when building custom clients or integrations, I've decided to extract the Auralite frontend from the backend and release it as open-source. That's right, **the Auralite frontend will be completely open-source, and make use of the same APIs you have access to**!

I've been hard at work migrating the web client to use Next.js. You can check out my progress (and contribute) [on GitHub](https://github.com/auralite/web).

And, while we're in the topic of clients, [Matthew Gleich](https://twitter.com/MattGleich) is working on an **unofficial mobile client** with Flutter! It's still on its early stages, but you can see his code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Matt-Gleich/auralite-mobile/).

## Thank You

I wanted to take a moment to **thank everyone that has decided to give Auralite a chance**. The reception has been amazing, and I'll try to get everyone on the platform as soon as possible!

The first wave of invites (a really small one, only 10 people to start testing out stuff) is already out, but **a second wave will be going out in a few days** and will include a few more people.

If you haven't already, make sure to sign up for early-access below so we can send you your Auralite invite when everything's ready.
