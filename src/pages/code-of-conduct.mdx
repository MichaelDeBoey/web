All Auralite users are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both on the platform and on any Auralite-related site.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as moderators of Auralite pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using _welcoming_ and _inclusive_ language
- Being _respectful_ of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and **using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain**
- Gracefully accepting _constructive criticism_
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing _empathy_ towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

We pledge to prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'I’m not discussing this with you.'
- Someone’s refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by sending an email to [mod@auralite.io](mailto:mod@auralite.io). We also plan to develop easier ways to report posts from the platform in the near future. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to suspend temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
